Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false


Reflection : 
    : the problem can intuitively be solved by sorting the given strings and checking if they are equal 

    : the other solution would be by using dictionary , ( adding both strings to two different dictionaries )
    { character : number of occurence }

    : compare the dictionaries and return true if they are same , 
    : else return false
