Merge Two sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

    : create dummy node method : 
        : DummyNode --> small1 --> small2

    : main algo
        create a dummy node 
        compare the values of the nodes and add the least to the next pointer of the dummy node
        traverse the list and the dummy node 

        if either list is pointing to nulll, it will halt thus 
            point the dummy pointer ( the last node of dummy ) , to the non-empty list
        : return the dummy node head

    : edge cases
        : having one either of empty list
        : reaching end of the list and looping
