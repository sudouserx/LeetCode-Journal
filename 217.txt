Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true


Reflection 

    : the problem could be solved through different methods ( it could be solved using O(n2) 
        complexity by using double loop and checking if the current element is equal to the following element )
    
    : the optimal solution would be to use a hashset or any DS that eleminate duplicate value , 
        : we check if the current number is already in the set , 
            return true,
        : we keep on adding the numbers until 
    reutrn false , since no duplicate is found
